# MODULE 21: Deep-learning-challenge

Instructions:

Step 1: Preprocess the Data
Using your knowledge of Pandas and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler(), you’ll need to preprocess the dataset. This step prepares you for Step 2, where you'll compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model.
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. You’ll need to think about how many inputs there are before determining the number of neurons and layers in your model. Once you’ve completed that step, you’ll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.
    
Step 3: Optimize the Model.
Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. Use any or all of the following methods to optimize your model:
Adjust the input data to ensure that no variables or outliers are causing confusion in the model, such as:
Dropping more or fewer columns.
Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
Add more neurons to a hidden layer.
Add more hidden layers.
Use different activation functions for the hidden layers.
Add or reduce the number of epochs to the training regimen.
    
Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model.
For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
